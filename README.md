# PlanCol

Black-and-white planet colonization sim. Based on NWjs.

# Usage

Download this repo (git clone, preferably), then download the appropriate NWjs binaries for your system and place them into the appropriate dir (from https://nwjs.io). This is lin64 for linux, mac64 for mac, and win64 for windows. Then copy the src dir to the root of that dir. Then run (lin/mac/win)64/nw. Alternatively, nw --debug will launch in debug mode.
